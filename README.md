# Block_Pick_and_place_automation
The tissue Block is Picked up by a gripper from the
tray which is controlled by Dynamixel motors
(which are in Daisy Chaining), Block can be placed
in different orientations and then can be perfectly
placed into the block holder, and after taking
sections, it can be put back in the tray. The Firmware
for Dynamixel and Rpi Pico was written in C and the
whole routine was written in Python.
